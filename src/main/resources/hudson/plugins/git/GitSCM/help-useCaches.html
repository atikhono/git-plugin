    <p>When checked, Jenkins will maintain a cached clone of the git
    repository on each agent where jobs are run.  It will use that cached
    clone as a reference repository for clones of that repository on
    that agent. The clone will be kept on each agent and updated before
    any other checkout of the repository. All jobs pointing to the same
    repository will use a single reference repository on each agent.</p>

    <p>If you have several jobs using the same remote repository,
    or one job using multiple workspaces, enabling this option can
    reduce agent disk usage and network data transfer.</p>
