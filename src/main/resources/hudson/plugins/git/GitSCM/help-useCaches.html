    <p>When checked, Hudson will maintain a clone of the Git repository
    in use as a reference for each clone of that repository. The clone
    will be kept on each node and updated before any other checkout of
    the repository. All jobs pointing to the same repository location
    will use a single reference repository on each node.</p>

    <p>If you have several jobs using the same repository location,
    or one job using multiple workspaces, enabling this option should
    substantially reduce the disk usage on your nodes.</p>
